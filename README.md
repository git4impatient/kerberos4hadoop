scripts to implement kerberos on a apache hadoop cluster with Cloudera Manager 

Apache Hadoop security has advanced significantly.  Kerberos is the foundation of securing your cluster.
With Kerberos enabled you can use Apache Sentry for Role Based Access Controls (RBAC)

Starting with the Cloudera Quickstart Virtual Machine (VM) the scripts will prep the image to 
enable Kerberos with Cloudera Manager.  The upcoming blog entry on the Cloudera web site includes a
guide to using the scripts and screen shots to navigate Cloudera Manager.
